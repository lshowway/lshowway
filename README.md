- 👀 My research interests include sentiment analysis, knowledge enhancement, word order, language model analysis, the future of NLP, and knowledge probing.
- 🌱 I'm also currently learning about probing the analogy relation in language models.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects about knowledge in LMs. If you have any relevant projects that you think I might be able to contribute to, I'd love to hear more about them.
